          <h2>Welcome to SERG Website!</h2>
          <p>
            We are SOAR (SOftware Analytics Research) group at School of
            Information System, Singapore Management University. We primarily
            work at the intersection of software engineering, cybersecurity and
            data science, encompassing socio-technical aspects, and analysis of
            different kinds of software artefacts (e.g., code, execution traces,
            bug reports, Q&A posts, and developer networks) and the interplay
            among them. We are particularly interested in transforming passive
            software engineering data into automated tools that can improve
            system reliability, security, and performance, increase developer
            productivity, and generate new insights for decision makers. We are
            also interested in connecting with practitioners to distil insights
            and discover pain points that can help direct future research
            effort.
